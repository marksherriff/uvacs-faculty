Visiting Professors . Visiting Professors are scholars from another institution, and their titles follow from their home institution, or in the case of Visitors from non-academic institutions, are given a title commensurate with their experience, with the approval of the CS tenure-track faculty and the Dean. Visiting Professors are expected to teach, lecture, or perform research on a topic for which they are an expert, and generally expected to play an active role in the Department. The appointments are for terms of one or two years and can only be renewed beyond two years with permission from the Provost. Visiting appointments are governed by University policy PROV-013. Courtesy Professors . Courtesy faculty have home departments within the University other than Computer Science, and such appointments are governed by University Policy PROV-029. They carry their rank from their primary department, and shall indicate their courtesy appointment in Computer Science with the phrase “(by courtesy)”. There are no formal responsibilities or rights attached to these faculty; however, courtesy faculty are expected to play an active role in the department. Specific rights may be granted according to a vote of the Computer Science faculty. Courtesy status is granted for up to three years and is renewable. In addition to reappointment reviews, these appointments must be reviewed by the Computer Science Department at times of a Courtesy faculty member’s promotion in their home department. The purpose of these reviews is to evaluate the suitability of continuing appointment in Computer Science. Adjunct Faculty . The Department may, from time to time, employ faculty on a part-time or wage basis, to teach specific courses. Adjunct faculty typically carry the title of Lecturer. There are no formal responsibilities or rights attached to these faculty, other than those related to their teaching duties; however, with approval of the chair and the CS Undergraduate Curriculum Committee, Adjunct Faculty may advise undergraduate research, e.g., senior theses, capstone projects, and independent studies. Additional rights may be granted according to a vote of the Computer Science Faculty. Adjunct faculty are referred to as “faculty wage employees” in University policy and are governed by University policy PROV-026. Emeritus Professor . The Emeritus Professors hold titles of Professor Emeritus or Associate Professor Emeritus, which are conferred upon retiring faculty, following nominations made to the UVA Board of Visitors. Recommendation of Emeritus status requires a vote of the Computer Science Faculty. These appointments are governed by University policy PROV-018 and SEAS policy 2016.2. ",

    "content": "For a motion to pass, a strict majority (one-half plus one) of the voting faculty must vote in the affirmative. The Department Chair is not counted in this majority, nor are those faculty members with secondary appointments and those who are on leave or sabbatical, unless they attend the meeting to vote or send a proxy or absentee vote (this provision is not meant to discourage participation of faculty with secondary appointments or those on leave or sabbatical, but rather to provide them with greater flexibility.) . A faculty member may also explicitly exclude themselves from the vote, and is then not counted toward the majority requirement. Those faculty members with voting privilege in the department unable to attend a meeting may submit absentee or proxy votes in advance of the start of the meeting as appropriate for a given agenda item and shall be counted as present for purpose of determining the strict majority. Unless otherwise stated, matters are settled by ordinary ballot (such as a show of hands or voice vote). Minor changes to the motions do not need another waiting period. Any eligible faculty member may request that a vote be taken by secret ballot (such as a written ballot), and that request shall be granted. Proxy votes allow members of the faculty to vote in meetings that they do not attend. Each proxy vote must be arranged in advance by agreement with another eligible member of the faculty (the delegate) and communicated in writing or by electronic mail to the chair. When the vote is taken, the delegate states publicly which absentee they are voting for; in an ordinary ballot the delegate then states the vote of the absentee, while in a secret ballot the delegate is given an extra ballot to fill out in behalf of the absentee. Proxy votes must be arranged independently for each issue and meeting. Proxy votes can be cast on modified motions as long as the delegate agrees. For a major change, the topic is carried to the next meeting. Absentee votes also allow members of the faculty to vote in meetings that they do not attend. Absentee votes differ from proxies, in that the absentee vote specifies a specific vote, while proxy votes are at the discretion of the individual carrying the proxy. Unless the agenda item to be voted upon is announced as urgent, faculty may submit absentee votes up to one business day (by 5pm) after the end of the faculty meeting. Topics not expected to be controversial can be recommended for an email or online vote. The motion and the recommendation for an email/online vote must be distributed five days in advance of the deadline for voting. A strict majority of the eligible faculty is still required for such a motion to pass. Proxies and secret ballots do not apply to email/online voting. Any faculty member may request the motion be discussed instead at a faculty meeting. The chair votes after the vote is counted and only does so if the vote of the chair could change the outcome of the vote. ",

Before investing energy in course (re)design, please verify that the chair supports the effort investment of a new/redesigned course. Note that chair approval does not guarantee UCC approval nor inclusion in any particular semester’s schedule. 2 The UCC needs to approve new and repeated 1511, 2501, 3501, and 4501 offerings. Submit your request by email to the UCC chair no later than 2 weeks before the schedule is due to allow time for discussion. Changes to lecture/lab allocations should be made at the same time. 3 You should have student-facing materials (a website, etc) for your new course available before the schedule is published to help students plan their course selection. 4 You should clarify the expectations of an independent study course before courses start if possible, or by the add deadline if you need to meet with the students first. You must provide the outcomes you will be grading to students before the drop deadline at the latest. ",
