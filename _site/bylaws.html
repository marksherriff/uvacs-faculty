Thus, the regular faculty of the Department consists of the tenure/tenure track and AGF faculty.</p> <h3 id="2111-tenuredtenure-track-faculty-tttf"> <a href="#2111-tenuredtenure-track-faculty-tttf" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="2111-tenuredtenure-track-faculty-tttf"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2.1.1.1 Tenured/Tenure-Track Faculty (TTTF) </h3> <p>The tenured/tenure track faculty (TTTF) of the Department hold the positions of Professor of Computer Science, Associate Professor of Computer Science, and Assistant Professor of Computer Science. The position of Associate Professor or Professor may be tenured or may be fixed-term and untenured. The position of Assistant Professor is fixed-term and untenured.</p> <p>A faculty member may have a joint appointment in the Department of Computer Science with other departments, typically with one department acting as the primary department (appointment &gt; 50%) and the others as secondary departments (appointment &lt; 50%). The funding and responsibilities are shared among the departments. The title of a joint faculty member follows from the primary department. Joint appointments shall be for a term of three years unless specified otherwise, and can be renewed. The Department shall maintain a policy governing joint appointments, which shall be in compliance with University-level policies.</p> <p>These appointments are governed by University policy <a href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-029">PROV-029</a> and any subsequent modifications or successor policies.</p> <h3 id="2112-academic-general-faculty-agf"> <a href="#2112-academic-general-faculty-agf" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="2112-academic-general-faculty-agf"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2.1.1.2 Academic General Faculty: AGF </h3> <p>The Academic General Faculty (AGF) hold the positions of Professor of Computer Science, Associate Professor of Computer Science, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, Distinguished Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, and Lecturer. The formal faculty title for the professorial ranks will specify both their rank and their membership in the General Faculty (e.g., Assistant Professor, General Faculty). Positions in this category customarily require teaching, educational and/or disciplinary scholarship, and service, in various combinations, as principal activities. These positions are tenure-ineligible and are fixed-term, renewable appointments, and are governed by University policy <a href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-004">PROV-004</a> and School-level policies. The reappointment or continued employment of AGF whose salaries are funded from grants, contracts or private gifts is subject to the continued availability of such funds.</p> <p>A General Faculty member may have a joint appointment in the Department of Computer Science with other departments, with one department acting as the primary department and the others as secondary departments.

Faculty Meetings </h2> <p>General faculty meetings are those at which primary business of the Department is discussed and acted upon (except for consideration of appointment, renewal, promotion, or tenure of faculty, which requires certain subsets of the faculty). The Chair, or their designated representative, will preside at all faculty meetings. The term “faculty meeting” when used in these Bylaws refers to a general, unrestricted meeting of the regular Department faculty. It is the responsibility of voting faculty with primary appointments in Computer Science to attend faculty meetings. Non-voting faculty are encouraged to attend faculty meetings.</p> <p>At the discretion of the Chair, discussion and votes on personnel issues may be made in closed meeting sessions that are only open to voting faculty. All voting faculty, including those on sabbatical or on personal leave, may attend and participate in all faculty meetings. Other faculty and a representative of the graduate students will be invited to attend and participate in portions of faculty meetings as appropriate.</p> <p>The following Department policies are among those discussed and voted on at faculty meetings:</p> <ul> <li>undergraduate curriculum, policies, degree requirements and strategies, in consultation with the Undergraduate Committees</li> <li>graduate curriculum, policies, degree requirements and strategies, in consultation with the Graduate Committee</li> <li>funding policies for graduate students, in consultation with the Graduate Committee and Admissions and Financial Aid Committee, and</li> </ul> <p>Other items to be discussed, but generally not voted on, at faculty meetings include:</p> <ul> <li>general departmental policies and planning, and</li> <li>faculty and graduate student recruitment strategies and priorities.</li> </ul> <h3 id="41-schedule-of-faculty-meetings"> <a href="#41-schedule-of-faculty-meetings" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="41-schedule-of-faculty-meetings"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 4.1 Schedule of Faculty Meetings </h3> <p>Whenever possible, the Chair schedules faculty meetings during the weekdays and at a time that minimizes conflicts with the teaching schedule of voting faculty members. There must be at least four faculty meetings called by the Chair for each Fall and Spring term. Other faculty meetings and meetings of subsets of the faculty are called by the Chair or the Chair’s designee upon four calendar days’ notice, except in the case of emergency meetings, which can be called with lesser notice. If three members of the Department faculty submit a written request and agenda for a faculty meeting, the Chair calls a meeting incorporating that agenda within one month.</p> <h3 id="42-agenda"> <a href="#42-agenda" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="42-agenda"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 4.2 Agenda </h3> <p>For faculty meetings and meetings of subsets of the faculty, the Chair or the Chair’s designee prepares the agenda and circulates it before each meeting. The agenda and draft motions are circulated at least four calendar days in advance of the meeting, except in the case of emergency meetings. Although other business may be discussed at the faculty meeting, official action may be taken only on items on the agenda.</p> <h3 id="43-minutes"> <a href="#43-minutes" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="43-minutes"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 4.3 Minutes </h3> <p>All decisions made at faculty meetings are recorded and distributed in minutes of the meetings. The minutes are confidential and their contents are not to be released in any manner for outside distribution, except with the approval of the faculty. The Chair may prepare the minutes or designate the preparer(s) of the minutes. The minutes of a faculty meeting are subject to revision by any faculty member by submission of corrections or elaborations. The amendments are appended verbatim to the draft of the minutes prior to the next faculty meeting. If no faculty member objects to the minutes or amendments by the beginning of the next faculty meeting, the minutes are then entered into the official record. A vote on the content of the minutes is taken only if requested and seconded by a voting faculty member. The minutes are filed electronically by the Chair’s Office and shall be available to regular faculty.</p> <h3 id="44-voting-and-proxies"> <a href="#44-voting-and-proxies" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="44-voting-and-proxies"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 4.4 Voting and Proxies </h3> <p>For a motion to pass, a strict majority (one-half plus one) of the voting faculty must vote in the affirmative. The Department Chair is not counted in this majority, nor are those faculty members with secondary appointments and those who are on leave or sabbatical, unless they attend the meeting to vote or send a proxy or absentee vote (this provision is not meant to discourage participation of faculty with secondary appointments or those on leave or sabbatical, but rather to provide them with greater flexibility.)</p> <p>A faculty member may also explicitly exclude themselves from the vote, and is then not counted toward the majority requirement. Those faculty members with voting privilege in the department unable to attend a meeting may submit absentee or proxy votes in advance of the start of the meeting as appropriate for a given agenda item and shall be counted as present for purpose of determining the strict majority.</p> <p>Unless otherwise stated, matters are settled by ordinary ballot (such as a show of hands or voice vote). Minor changes to the motions do not need another waiting period. Any eligible faculty member may request that a vote be taken by secret ballot (such as a written ballot), and that request shall be granted.</p> <p>Proxy votes allow members of the faculty to vote in meetings that they do not attend. Each proxy vote must be arranged in advance by agreement with another eligible member of the faculty (the delegate) and communicated in writing or by electronic mail to the chair. When the vote is taken, the delegate states publicly which absentee they are voting for; in an ordinary ballot the delegate then states the vote of the absentee, while in a secret ballot the delegate is given an extra ballot to fill out in behalf of the absentee. Proxy votes must be arranged independently for each issue and meeting. Proxy votes can be cast on modified motions as long as the delegate agrees. For a major change, the topic is carried to the next meeting.</p> <p>Absentee votes also allow members of the faculty to vote in meetings that they do not attend. Absentee votes differ from proxies, in that the absentee vote specifies a specific vote, while proxy votes are at the discretion of the individual carrying the proxy. Unless the agenda item to be voted upon is announced as urgent, faculty may submit absentee votes up to one business day (by 5pm) after the end of the faculty meeting.</p> <p>Topics not expected to be controversial can be recommended for an email or online vote. The motion and the recommendation for an email/online vote must be distributed five days in advance of the deadline for voting. A strict majority of the eligible faculty is still required for such a motion to pass. Proxies and secret ballots do not apply to email/online voting. Any faculty member may request the motion be discussed instead at a faculty meeting.</p> <p>The chair votes after the vote is counted and only does so if the vote of the chair could change the outcome of the vote.</p> <h2 id="5--communications-and-notice"> <a href="#5--communications-and-notice" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="5--communications-and-notice"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 5. Communications and Notice </h2> <p>Electronic mail is a sufficient and appropriate notice for meetings of the Department. Faculty are expected to check their electronic mail at least every working day, while in residence. When the participants involved agree, electronic communications (e.g., email, Skype, conference call) may be used to present, discuss, and decide issues that would otherwise require a meeting.</p> <h2 id="6-appointments-promotions-and-reappointments"> <a href="#6-appointments-promotions-and-reappointments" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="6-appointments-promotions-and-reappointments"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6.

In case of an external chair, a search committee is organized to recruit, evaluate, and recommend a set of candidates to the Dean, in consultation with the voting Faculty. In case of an internal candidate, the Dean appoints a committee, which solicits advice from each voting member of the regular faculty before making a recommendation to the Dean. An annual review of the Department Chair will be carried out by an ad-hoc committee consisting of all of the Full Professors in the Department, or according to other policies that may be promulgated by the School or University.</p> <h3 id="612-associate-chair-appointment"> <a href="#612-associate-chair-appointment" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="612-associate-chair-appointment"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6.1.2 Associate Chair Appointment </h3> <p>Appointment of an Associate Chair is made by the Chair.

If the appointee has a term appointment, the appointment of Assistant or Associate Chair cannot extend beyond the end of a faculty member’s term.</p> <h3 id="613-tenure-track-and-academic-general-faculty-appointments"> <a href="#613-tenure-track-and-academic-general-faculty-appointments" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="613-tenure-track-and-academic-general-faculty-appointments"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6.1.3 Tenure-Track and Academic-General-Faculty Appointments </h3> <p>A Faculty Search Committee (ad hoc), appointed by the Chair, Dean, or Provost or their designees, is responsible for administering the recruitment of new tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty. The Faculty Search Committee actively solicits the views of the voting faculty regarding the desired qualifications of candidates for open positions and formulates an advertisement to attract such candidates. The Faculty Search Committee reviews applications for the positions and identifies a set of finalists who are invited for full interviews. After each candidate’s visit, the Faculty Search Committee solicits evaluations from the voting faculty, appropriate non-voting faculty, and students, and uses these evaluations to formulate a recommendation that is presented to the voting faculty for discussion at a faculty meeting, with the Chair in attendance. Votes may be taken to indicate level of support, but these votes are advisory to the search committee and do not follow the quorum rules in Section 4.4. The search committee then makes a final recommendation to the Chair. The Department Chair makes the decision from the list of recommended candidates and presents their recommendations to the Dean.</p> <h3 id="614-courtesy-faculty-appointments"> <a href="#614-courtesy-faculty-appointments" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="614-courtesy-faculty-appointments"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6.1.4 Courtesy Faculty Appointments </h3> <p>A faculty member whose primary appointment is in another department may be considered for a courtesy appointment in Computer Science at any time. A recommendation for appointment requires an affirmative vote according to the voting rules in Section 4.4, and the approval of the Department Chair. If approved, the term is for up to three years and renewable with an affirmative vote according to the voting rules in Section 4.4.</p> <h3 id="615-joint-appointments"> <a href="#615-joint-appointments" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="615-joint-appointments"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6.1.5 Joint Appointments </h3> <p>A faculty member whose primary appointment is in another department may be considered for a secondary Joint Appointment in Computer Science at any time. Except in cases where a joint appointment is part of a hiring package, the recommendation to make such an appointment may not be voted on in the first meeting where it is discussed, meaning that each joint appointment will be considered at two or more meetings of the voting faculty. External letters may be requested but are not necessary. A recommendation for appointment requires an affirmative vote according to the voting rules in Section 4.4 and the approval of the Department Chair. If the Department recommends a Joint Appointment, the Chair reports the Department’s action to the Dean, and if the appointment is approved, the Dean writes a letter of appointment to the candidate. If approved, the term is for three years and renewable with an affirmative vote according to the voting rules in Section 4.4. Details of joint appointments will be covered by a departmental policy.</p> <h3 id="616-professional-research-staff-appointments"> <a href="#616-professional-research-staff-appointments" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="616-professional-research-staff-appointments"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6.1.6 Professional Research Staff Appointments </h3> <p>The professor who will be responsible for the funding and management of the Professional Research Staff member recruits candidates and makes an offer, after written approval of the Department Chair. However, in accordance with SEAS and university guidelines, hiring a senior research professional staff member (Research Scientists, Senior Scientists, and Principle Scientists) requires a search committee. A Department Search Committee, composed of regular faculty and staff members, is appointed by the Chair. This Committee performs the overall evaluation and provides a written recommendation to the Chair. Subject to the approval of the professor who is responsible for funding and management, the chair submits their recommendation to the Dean. These appointments are for a specified term, typically from 1 to 3 years, renewable. See UVA Policy on Professional Research staff for more information.</p> <h2 id="62-promotion-reappointments-and-tenure"> <a href="#62-promotion-reappointments-and-tenure" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="62-promotion-reappointments-and-tenure"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6.2 Promotion, Reappointments and Tenure </h2> <h3 id="621-chair-reappointment"> <a href="#621-chair-reappointment" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="621-chair-reappointment"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6.2.1 Chair Reappointment </h3> <p>The Chair is normally appointed for a four-year term. Renewal is possible after an evaluation performed by a committee appointed by the Dean. This committee solicits information from the Department about the Chair’s performance. The committee reports to the Dean, who makes the renewal decision. The Chair normally serves no more than two consecutive terms.</p> <h3 id="622-tenuretenure-track-and-academic-general-faculty-promotion-reappointments-and-tenure"> <a href="#622-tenuretenure-track-and-academic-general-faculty-promotion-reappointments-and-tenure" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="622-tenuretenure-track-and-academic-general-faculty-promotion-reappointments-and-tenure"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6.2.2 Tenure/Tenure-Track and Academic General Faculty Promotion, Reappointments and Tenure </h3> <p>The criteria and procedure for promotion are provided in the SEAS Promotion and Tenure Policy found at <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty-staff/uva-engineering-policies-procedures">https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty-staff/uva-engineering-policies-procedures</a></p> <p>Reappointment and promotion are considered first by a Department Promotion and Tenure Subcommittee, appointed by the chair. This Subcommittee should have representation including both Tenured/Tenure-Track and Academic General Faculty and diverse research areas. The Department Chair may chair the Departmental Promotion and Tenure Subcommittee or may delegate this position to a tenured faculty member with a higher rank than the candidate. This Committee provides the Department Chair and all faculty members with a higher rank than the candidate (i.e., the full Departmental Promotion and Tenure Committee), who are eligible to vote on Promotion and Tenure matters, with a written evaluation of the performance of the candidate being considered for reappointment, promotion, and tenure. All of the faculty members with primary appointments (&gt;= 50%) in the department and with rank above that of the candidate vote in a secret ballot on the recommendation of the Committee. (For cases in which a full professor is being considered for hiring with tenure, the voting faculty will be full professors with primary appointments in the department.)</p> <p>If a substantial portion of a candidate’s research is cross-disciplinary, appropriate members from other departments may be invited to provide input about the candidate.</p> <p>All deliberations for tenure, reappointment and promotion shall be kept confidential. It is serious breach of professional ethics for members to discuss the deliberations of the Department Promotion and Tenure Committee with non-members, especially regarding the individual candidate being considered.</p> <h2 id="7-adoption"> <a href="#7-adoption" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="7-adoption"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 7. Adoption </h2> <p>These Bylaws shall be adopted and shall be in full force and effect upon (1) approval by the voting faculty of the Department of Computer Science and the Department Chair, which shall require at least a two-thirds approval by the voting faculty, and the vote shall be by secret ballot; and (2) approval by the Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.</p> <h3 id="71-amendments"> <a href="#71-amendments" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="71-amendments"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 7.1 Amendments </h3> <p>Any voting faculty member of the Department, or the Chair, may propose amendment of these Bylaws, in whole or in part, in accordance with the following procedure:</p> <p>Upon receipt of a written amendment proposal, the Chair shall provide written notice to the voting faculty, containing the complete substance of the proposed amendment, at least two weeks in advance of a meeting at which the proposal is to be considered. The Amendment may be introduced as a Motion of Amendment to Bylaws Previously Adopted. Such a motion is debatable and can be amended. The proposed amendment may be adopted and shall be in full force and effect upon approval by a two-thirds approval vote of the voting faculty using a secret ballot.</p> </main> </div> </div> <button id="search-button" class="search-button btn-reset" aria-label="Focus on search"> <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-search"></use></svg> </button> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
