# UVA CS Department Policies and Procedures

Site Last Updated: {{ site.time | date: '%A, %B %d, %Y' }}

This website is maintained by the faculty and staff of the Department of Computer Science and is intended to be a resource for faculty and staff regarding the policy, procedures, and operations of the department.  We work to keep this website as up-to-date as possible, but if there are any conflicts between this website and official resources provided by the University of Virginia (e.g., information from the Registrar's Office, the official Academic Record, the Dean's office, UVA HR, etc.), the official resources should be considered the authoritative source.  Please report any discrepancies or suggestions for other content to [sherriff@virginia.edu](mailto:sherriff@virginia.edu).
