## SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
Students with disabilities may wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at [cmacmasters@virginia.edu](mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu) to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: [sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu](http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu).
